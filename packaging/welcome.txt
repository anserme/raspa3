RASPA is a software package for simulating adsorption and diffusion of molecules in flexible nanoporous materials. The code implements the latest state-of-the-art algorithms for Molecular Dynamics and Monte Carlo in various ensembles including symplectic/measure-preserving integrators, Ewald summation, Configurational-Bias Monte Carlo, Continuous Fractional Component Monte Carlo, Reactive Monte Carlo, and Bakerâ€™s minimization. Applications of RASPA include computing coexistence properties, adsorption isotherms for single and multiple components, self- and collective diffusivities, reaction systems, and visualization.
